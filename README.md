Header files inside [angel/](https://github.com/benwiley4000/angel-computer-graphics/tree/master/angel) directory, as well as [InitShader.cpp](https://github.com/benwiley4000/angel-computer-graphics/blob/master/InitShader.cpp) are copied nearly verbatim. Other files are based on book exercises, but may have inconsistencies with the book prompts, as well as changes to ensure system compatibility.
